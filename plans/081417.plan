* Refactor exec.js: move different workflows to files of their own
* Refactor controllers.js: move all controllers to their own files
* Add GET /tasks/:name route to return info about task (size, runtime, name)
* Refactor POST /tasks/run to POST /tasks/:name/run (only send runtime in the reqBody)

* Figure out deployment: cloudformation/consul/terraform etc.
* Read up on Unikernels: http://unikernel.org/files/2014-cacm-unikernels.pdf
